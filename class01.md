#  HTML and CSS
### how peopLe access the web
#### Before we look at the code used to build websites it is important to consider the different ways in which people access the web and clarify some terminology.
* Browsers:People access websites using software called a web browser. Popular examples include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.

* web servers:When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a web server which hosts the website.

* screen readers:Screen readers are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user. They are commonly used by people with visual impairments.

* devices:People are accessing websites on an increasing range of devices including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

#### When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

### Structur
#### HTML describes the structure of pages and HTML uses eLements to describe the structure of pages.

#### Tags 
* tags are often referred to as elements
* tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.

# Extra Markup
#### DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
#### You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
#### The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
#### The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
#### <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
#### The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
#### Escape characters are used to include special  X characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

# HTML5 Layout
#### HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.
#### HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. 
#### The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.
#### The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:
* The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
* A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.

#### <nav>
#### The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

#### <article>
#### The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

#### <aside>
#### The <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not.
* When the <aside> element is used inside an <article> element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. For example, a pullquote or glossary might be considered as an aside to the article it relates to.
* When the <aside> element is used outside of an <article> element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page. For example, it might contain links to other sections of the site, a list of recent posts, a search box, or recent tweets by the author.

#### <section>
#### The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

#### <hgroup>
#### The purpose of the <hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading. 

#### <figure> <figcaption>
####  It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images). 

# Process & Design 
#### Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.
#### if you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.

#### How do I write a script for a web page? 

### A script
#### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
#### To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
#### Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.
#### Every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written in a language the computer can understand and follow. 
#### Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations. You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together. The flowcharts show the paths between each step. 

### How do computers fit in with the world around them?
#### Computers use data to create models of things in the real world. The events, methods, and properties of an object all relate to each other: Events can trigger methods, and methods can retrieve or update an object's properties.

### How do I write a script for a web page?
#### These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancement. 
#### JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day. 
#### When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML <script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored. 
#### If you look at the source code for the example you just created, you will see that the HTML is still exactly the same.
#### You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening <script> and closing </script> tags (but it is better to put scripts in their own files).
