## what is css
### CSS associates styLe ruLes with HTML eLements
* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

# Basic JavaScript Instructions
### STATEMENTS:Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon. 
### COMMENTS :You should write comments to explain what your code does. 
### WHAT IS A VARIABLE? A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. 
### Expressions: rely on operators to calculate a value
## descisions and loops
### Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next. 
### Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands. 
### Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 
### if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
