# list
### There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:
* Ordered lists  :<ol>
* Unordered lists :<ul>
* Definition lists :<dl>

# Boxes
### At the beginning of this section on CSS, you saw how CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.
### box diminsion (width and hight):By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. 
### To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.
### overflow(hidden and scroll):hidden This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box,scroll This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.
### The border-width:  a property used it to control the width of a border. 
### You can control the style of a border using the border-style property.
### You can specify the color of a border using either RGB values:
**border-top-color**
**border-right-color**
**border-bottom-color**
**border-left-color**
