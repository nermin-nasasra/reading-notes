**Links**
### Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.
### Links are created using the <a> element.
### ex.   <a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>.
### emAiL Links.
#### mailto:To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address <a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a> .
### You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

**Layout**
### Building Blocks
### CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
### Block-level elements start on a new line Examples include: <h1> <p> <ul> <li>
### containing elements
### If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

**Functions, Methods, and Objects**
### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
### A function declaration creates a function that you can call later in your code. It is the type of function you have seen so far in this book. 
### If you put a function where the interpreter would expect to see an expression, then it is treated as an expression, and it is known as a function expression.
