# ** OBJECT **
## JS chapter3
## WHAT IS AN OBJECT? 
### Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names. 
### var nameit{ statments; };


# ** Document Object Model **
## JS chapter5
### DOM: specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 
### Each node is an object with methods and properties. Scripts access and update this DOM tree (not the source HTML file). Any changes made to the DOM tree are reflected in the browser. 
### METHODS THAT RETURN A SINGLE ELEMENT NODE: 
* getElementByld( 'id' )
* querySelector( 'css selector')
* getElementsByClassName( 'class ' )
* getElementsByTagName( ' tagName ' )
* querySelectorAll ('css selector') 
### An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other. 
### In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).
