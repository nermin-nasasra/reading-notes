### containing ElEmEnts
### If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
### ControLLing the position of eLements
### CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.
###  elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
### Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
### The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
